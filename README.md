This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Rust: using raw pointers to modify vectors without proper care.  The code modifies a vector's first element using a raw pointer. Because vectors can reallocate internally when their capacity is exceeded, using the raw pointer after a potential reallocation leads to undefined behavior and likely a crash. The solution shows the safe and idiomatic way to modify a vector's element without resorting to unsafe code.
